**Matrix Manipulator** is an academic project designed to provide students, educators, and researchers with an accessible and user-friendly platform for performing matrix operations. Our goal is to simplify complex matrix calculations and offer interactive learning experiences for those studying linear algebra and related fields.

---

### Project Overview

The **Matrix Manipulator** app allows users to:
- Perform a variety of matrix operations, such as **Transpose**, **Determinant**, **Inverse**, and **Cholesky Decomposition**.
- View and manipulate matrices in LaTeX format for clarity and ease of use.
- Input matrices manually, generate them randomly, or upload them via CSV files.
- Interact with an AI-powered chatbot (**MatX**) for assistance with algebra and matrix-related concepts.
- Download processed matrices as CSV files for further analysis.

This project is designed to support learning and research in fields that heavily rely on matrix mathematics, such as data science, machine learning, and engineering.
